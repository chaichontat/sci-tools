# Fix mess

v2 has barcode errors which mean that the minimum Hamming distance is < 4.

- Replace all RT
- Lig, replace half to get barcode to 10 bp ( no more stagger, just use dark cycles)
- P5, replace 22.
- P7, add 72 to existing 24 to fill plate.
- P7adt, new, use linker to allow pooled second amp.

**Transplanted the last two of new P7 to the P5 plate to get it to 24.**
